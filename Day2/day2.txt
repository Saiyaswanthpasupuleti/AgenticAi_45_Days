What is Prompting?

Prompting is the way we give instructions, questions, or context to an AI so it can understand what to do and how to respond.

In simple words:
👉 Prompting = talking to AI in a structured and clear way.

The better the prompt, the better the output.

Types of Prompting
1. Zero-Shot Prompting

Definition:
In Zero-Shot Prompting, you ask a question without giving any examples.
The AI answers based only on its existing knowledge.

Example:

Prompt:

Explain what ReactJS is.

Output:

ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially single-page applications.

👉 No examples provided, straight question → straight answer.

2. One-Shot Prompting

Definition:
In One-Shot Prompting, you give one example so the AI understands the pattern and follows it.

Example:

Prompt:

Example:
Input: 2 + 2
Output: The answer for the given question is 4

Now solve this:
Input: 1 + 1

Output:

The answer for the given question is 2

👉 One example is enough for the AI to learn the response style.

3. Few-Shot Prompting

Definition:
In Few-Shot Prompting, you give multiple examples to clearly guide the AI on format, logic, and tone.

Example:

Prompt:

Example 1:
Input: 12 ÷ 2
Output: The answer for the given question is 6

Example 2:
Input: 12 − 2
Output: The answer for the given question is 10

Now solve this:
Input: 22 + 11

Output:

The answer for the given question is 33

👉 More examples = more control over output.

4. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Definition:
Chain-of-Thought Prompting encourages the AI to think step-by-step before giving the final answer.

This improves reasoning for:

Math problems

Logic problems

Multi-step decisions

Example:

Prompt:

Solve the problem step by step:
What is (10 + 5) × 2?

Output:

Step 1: Add 10 and 5 → 15
Step 2: Multiply 15 by 2 → 30
Final Answer: 30

👉 The AI explains how it reached the answer.

5. Persona-Based Prompting

Definition:
Persona-Based Prompting tells the AI who it should act like while responding.

You define:

Role

Tone

Expertise

Audience

Example 1: Developer Persona

Prompt:

Act as a Senior Frontend Developer.
Explain ReactJS to a beginner using simple language and examples.

Output:

ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces.
It helps developers create reusable UI components and efficiently update the screen when data changes.
